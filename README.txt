This code aims to randomly generate chromosome segments, relate them with randomly selected genes, and simulate the eQTLs (RC.eQTLs). The length of each RC.eQTL was randomly chosen from a file. And the number of RC.eQTL for each gene following distinct frequency distribution.
Three files should be prepared as follows:
1. The “chromosome length file” that contains the name and length of each chromosome;
2. The “gene name file” contains all the gene names.
3. The “chromosome length file” contains the length of each actual eQTL.
Note:
1. The gene number that participates in RC.eQTL generation could be modified.
2. For convenience, this code was designed to auto-operate for distinct times.
3. The frequency distribution of the RC.eQTL number of each gene should be directly specified in the code.
